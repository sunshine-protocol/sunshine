# User Story

The simplicity of the Moloch mechanism lies in how it treats Members and Grants as the same type of proposal.

## Membership Application

In practice, membership applications require some ratio of 1 share to 1 ETH (for Moloch, MetaCartel). This is not enforced by the protocol. The flexibility provided by no initial screening mechanism allows the DAO to respond carefully to each specific use case.

Costs:
* ApplicantBond
* ProposalBond (in terms of membership shares)

## Grant Application

Some notable team requires a grant.
